I like to keep my set up simple and try to work with as little abstractions as 
possible. This forces me to work at a lower-level of abstraction with my tools 
and really understand how everything works.

“Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes 
and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.”

― Frédéric Chopin
