# Philosophy

My setup is constantly evolving over time, but in general I like to keep it as 
minimal as possible. Following this approach has a couple of benefits:

- I am able to quickly set up a development environment whenever I get a new computer.

- Working with a small set of core tools allows my depth of knowledge and proficiency
to quickly compound over time.

- I like to know what is going on under the hood. Working with these minimal tools
forces me to have a deep understanding of everything that is going on from compile
to runtime. This makes it easier to debug when things go wrong.

“Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes 
and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.”

― Frédéric Chopin
